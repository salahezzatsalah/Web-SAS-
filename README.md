Student Advisory System (SAS)
Many students encounter difficulties when registering for courses each semester and effectively communicating with their academic advisors. These challenges often lead to delays in course selection, scheduling conflicts, and a lack of clarity regarding academic requirements. Recognizing the need for a solution, we have embarked on the development of a comprehensive Student Advisory System (SAS).

Our goal is to alleviate the registration and communication struggles faced by students by providing them with a user-friendly platform to interact with their academic advisors seamlessly. The Student Advisory System (SAS) aims to streamline the course registration process, facilitate direct communication channels between students and advisors, and enable efficient problem-solving mechanisms.

By implementing the Student Advisory System (SAS), we seek to empower students to navigate their academic journey with confidence and efficiency. Through improved registration processes and enhanced communication channels, we aim to enhance the overall academic experience and contribute to student success.
